### Project: EduTrack

EduTrack is a powerful desktop app designed for SOC tutors, allowing them to streamline their teaching tasks and effortlessly track their student records.
The user interacts with it using a CLI, and it has a GUI created with JavaFX. It is written in Java, and has about 11 kLoC.

Given below are my contributions to the project.

* **New Features**:
  * Added the ability to remove student from his or her class.
    * <u>What it does</u>
    <br>It allows users to easily remove a student from their class.
    * <u>Justification</u>
    <br>This feature streamlines class roster updates, accommodating user errors in student placement and
    facilitating adjustments when students leave their classes for various reasons.

  * Added the ability to simulate the start of a lesson.
    * <u>What it does</u>
    <br>It helps user to update multiple class records when initiating a new lesson. It automatically increments the total lesson count and resets the attendance sheet for marking student attendance.

### Project: EduTrack

EduTrack is a  product is for teaching assistants in universities who type fast and have many classes to manage. It is optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). If you can type fast, EduTrack can get your student and class management tasks done faster than traditional GUI apps.

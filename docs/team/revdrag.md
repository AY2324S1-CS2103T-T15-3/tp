### Project: EduTrack

EduTrack is a desktop app for managing classes designed for tutors, optimized for use via a Command Line Interface (CLI) while still having the benefits of a Graphical User Interface (GUI). Whether you're juggling multiple students or just need quick access to individual student data, EduTrack empowers you with effortless control and organization.
